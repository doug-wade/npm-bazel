## Testing

Yeah!  Do it!

Head over to [react-server-test-pages](/packages/react-server-test-pages) and
check out the README to get a test server set up.

Add some automated [integration
tests](/packages/react-server-integration-tests) if you're up for it.

If nothing else, check for regressions:

```bash
npm test
```

That will, among other things, run [`eslint`](/.eslintrc).
